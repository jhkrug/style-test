# Topic based content

This extracts topics from a `topics.adoc` file in the `partials` directory.

This should include just for topic 1.

include::partial$topics.adoc[tag=topic-1]

And this for topic 2.

include::partial$topics.adoc[tag=topic-2]

And again for topic 1.

include::partial$topics.adoc[tag=topic-1]
